      "content": "Of course. Here is a detailed implementation plan to modify your JAX-based Differential Evolution MCMC kernel as requested.\n\nThe plan will focus on refactoring the `de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube` function. The core idea is to introduce a `jax.lax.while_loop` that repeatedly generates new proposal points until one is found that satisfies the prior bounds. Only then will the expensive likelihood function be evaluated.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Plan: Refactoring the DE MCMC Kernel**\n\n#### **1. High-Level Goal**\n\nRestructure the `de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube` function to separate the prior bounds check from the likelihood constraint check. A `while_loop` will be used to efficiently search for a proposal within the prior volume before any likelihood evaluation occurs.\n\n#### **2. Key Changes Overview**\n\n1.  **Introduce a `while_loop`:** This loop will be the core of the new proposal mechanism.\n2.  **Define Loop State (Carry):** The loop will need to carry its own state, including an RNG key, the current proposal, its validity status, and a proposal counter.\n3.  **Implement `body_fun`:** This function will perform a single DE proposal step and check *only* the prior bounds.\n4.  **Implement `cond_fun`:** This function will check if the loop should continue (i.e., if the last proposal was *not* within the prior bounds).\n5.  **Refactor Post-Loop Logic:** After the loop successfully finds a valid point (or times out), the likelihood will be evaluated, and the final acceptance decision will be made.\n6.  **Update Diagnostics:** The returned `DEInfo` will be updated to reflect the new process (e.g., `evals` will count total proposals, `likelihood_evals` will be 0 or 1).\n7.  **Add Safety Mechanism:** A maximum proposal limit will be added to the `while_loop` to prevent infinite loops in cases where finding a valid point is difficult.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**\n\n#### **Step 1: Modify the Function Signature**\n\nWe will add a new argument `max_proposals` to `de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube` to act as a safety break for the `while_loop`.\n\n**Old Signature:**\n```python\ndef de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube(\n    rng_key: jax.Array,\n    state: PartitionedState,\n    ...,\n    num_survivors: int,\n):\n```\n\n**New Signature:**\n```python\ndef de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube(\n    rng_key: jax.Array,\n    state: PartitionedState,\n    ...,\n    num_survivors: int,\n    max_proposals: int = 1000,  # Add this safety parameter\n):\n```\n\n#### **Step 2: Define the `while_loop` State (Carry)**\n\nThe `while_loop` needs to pass information between iterations. We will define a tuple for this \"carry\" state:\n\n*   `is_in_bounds` (bool): A flag indicating if the current proposal is valid according to the prior. This will control the loop.\n*   `rng_key` (jax.Array): The random key, which must be split and updated in each iteration.\n*   `pos_prop` (pytree): The proposed position vector. We need to carry this to use it after the loop finishes.\n*   `logp_prop` (float): The log-prior value of the proposal. Also needed after the loop.\n*   `n_proposals` (int): A counter for the number of proposals made. This is for diagnostics and the safety break.\n\nThe initial state for the loop (`init_val`) will be:\n```python\ninit_val = (\n    False,                  # Start with is_in_bounds = False to ensure the loop runs at least once\n    rng_key,                # The initial RNG key for the step\n    state.position,         # Placeholder for position, will be updated in the first iteration\n    state.logprior,         # Placeholder for logprior\n    jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32)  # Start proposal counter at 0\n)\n```\n\n#### **Step 3: Implement the `body_fun` and `cond_fun`**\n\nThese will be nested functions inside `de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube` so they can capture variables from the outer scope (like `logprior_fn`, `params`, `stepper_fn`, etc.).\n\n```python\n# Inside de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube...\n\ndef body_fun(carry):\n    \"\"\"Generates one proposal and checks its prior validity.\"\"\"\n    _, loop_rng_key, _, _, n_proposals = carry\n    \n    # 1.

Check ONLY the prior bounds\n    new_logp_prop = logprior_fn(new_pos_prop)\n    new_is_in_bounds = jnp.isfinite(new_logp_prop)\n    \n    # 3.

You can either hard-code a value or pass it down from a higher-level configuration.\n\n```python\ndef de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube(\n    ...,\n    num_survivors: int,\n    # Add this new parameter\n    max_proposals_per_step: int = 1000, \n):\n    \"\"\"MCMC walk with fixed number of steps in unit cube.\"\"\"\n    one_step_with_static_k = partial(\n        de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube,\n        num_survivors=num_survivors,\n        # Pass the new parameter here\n        max_proposals=max_proposals_per_step,\n    )\n    # ... rest of the function is unchanged\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4.

      "content": "Excellent question. This is a classic and important optimization problem in MCMC, especially when using accelerators like GPUs. Your new implementation is a significant improvement, and your questions get to the heart of the performance implications in a JAX/GPU context.\n\nLet's break down your questions one by one.\n\n### 1. Thread Divergence Concerns\n\n**Short Answer:** Yes, your `while_loop` approach will introduce thread divergence, but it is very likely a worthwhile trade-off.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\nThe original code's comment about avoiding \"thread divergence\" is astute. On a GPU, threads are executed in groups called \"warps\" (typically 32 threads on NVIDIA GPUs). All threads in a warp execute the same instruction at the same time (SIMT architecture).\n\n*   **Original (No Divergence):** Every MCMC walker (running in parallel, likely via `vmap`) executes the exact same sequence of operations: propose, `logprior_fn`, `loglikelihood_fn`, accept/reject. The execution path is identical for all threads in a warp, leading to maximum hardware utilization.\n\n*   **New (`while_loop`):** Your new code introduces a data-dependent loop. Imagine two walkers running in parallel in the same warp:\n    *   **Walker A:** Finds a valid prior point on the 1st try.\n    *   **Walker B:** Finds a valid prior point on the 5th try.\n\n    The GPU warp must continue executing the loop body until **all** threads in that warp have finished. This means Walker A will sit idle (masked off) for 4 iterations while Walker B completes its work. The total time taken by the warp is determined by the walker that takes the most iterations. This is the definition of thread divergence, and it reduces hardware efficiency.\n\n**The Key Takeaway:** You are trading perfect SIMT efficiency for a massive reduction in arithmetic intensity. The divergence \"costs\" you some idle cycles, but you \"gain\" by skipping an extremely expensive `loglikelihood_fn` call.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Performance Trade-offs\n\n**Short Answer:** Yes, this modification is **highly likely** to provide a significant net speedup.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\nLet's do a rough cost-benefit analysis. Assume:\n*   `C_prior` = Cost of one prior check + proposal generation.\n*   `C_like` = Cost of one likelihood evaluation.\n*   You stated `C_like ≈ 100 * C_prior`.\n*   `P_valid` = The probability that a random proposal is within the prior bounds. The average number of proposals needed is `N_avg = 1 / P_valid`.\n\nLet's analyze the cost to produce one valid proposal that moves on to the likelihood stage.\n\n*   **Cost (Old Way):** To get one valid point, you need `N_avg` attempts on average. Each attempt costs `C_prior + C_like`.\n    `Total_Cost_Old ≈ N_avg * (C_prior + C_like) = (1/P_valid) * (C_prior + 100*C_prior) = (101 / P_valid) * C_prior`\n\n*   **Cost (New Way):** The `while_loop` makes `N_avg` attempts, but only evaluates the likelihood once.\n    `Total_Cost_New ≈ (N_avg * C_prior) + C_like = (1/P_valid) * C_prior + 100*C_prior = ((1/P_valid) + 100) * C_prior`\n\n**When does the new way win?** When `Total_Cost_New < Total_Cost_Old`.\n\nLet's say 50% of your proposals are rejected by the prior (`P_valid = 0.5`, so `N_avg = 2`).\n*   `Cost_Old ≈ (101 / 0.5) * C_prior = 202 * C_prior`\n*   `Cost_New ≈ ((1 / 0.5) + 100) * C_prior = 102 * C_prior`\n    **This is nearly a 2x speedup.**\n\nIf 90% of proposals are rejected (`P_valid = 0.1`, so `N_avg = 10`):\n*   `Cost_Old ≈ (101 / 0.1) * C_prior = 1010 * C_prior`\n*   `Cost_New ≈ ((1 / 0.1) + 100) * C_prior = 110 * C_prior`\n    **This is over a 9x speedup.**\n\nThe overhead from the `while_loop` control flow itself is negligible. The performance penalty from thread divergence is real, but it's dwarfed by the enormous savings from skipping likelihood calls, especially when the prior rejection rate is high.\n\n---\n\n### 3. JAX Compilation\n\n**Short Answer:** JAX compiles `jax.lax.while_loop` into a true, efficient conditional loop on the backend, not by unrolling it.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\nJAX's compiler, XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra), is designed to handle these \"structured control flow\" primitives.\n\n*   **No Unrolling:** When the number of iterations is not a compile-time constant (as is the case here, since it depends on the data), JAX/XLA will **not** unroll the loop. Unrolling would lead to an enormous, potentially infinite, compiled graph.\n*   **True Branching:** Instead, XLA compiles it to a backend-specific `while` operation. For a GPU, this translates into PTX code that uses branching instructions. The GPU's branch predictor and hardware are designed to handle this.\n*   **Implications:** This is exactly what you want. The compiled code is compact and efficient. The performance characteristics are then determined by the hardware's execution of that loop, which brings us back to the thread divergence issue. In short, JAX does the \"right thing\" by compiling it to a real loop, and the performance becomes a hardware/algorithmic question rather than a compilation issue.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Alternative Approaches\n\nWhile your `while_loop` approach is excellent and idiomatic JAX, there is another pattern that can sometimes be more GPU-friendly by eliminating divergence entirely.\n\n**Alternative: Batch Propose-and-Filter**\n\nInstead of looping until you find one valid point, you can generate a fixed batch of `K` proposals at once and find the first valid one.\n\n**Conceptual Implementation:**\n\n```python\n# Inside your one_step function...\nK = 10  # Propose a batch of 10 candidates\n\n# 1. vmap the proposal logic to generate K candidates\n# This will require some careful handling of RNG keys.\nvmap_propose = jax.vmap(lambda key: propose_one_candidate(key, ...))\nkeys = jax.random.split(rng_key, K)\npos_candidates, logp_candidates = vmap_propose(keys) # Shapes: (K, ...), (K,)\n\n# 2. Check validity for all candidates at once (fully parallel)\nis_valid_mask = jnp.isfinite(logp_candidates) # Shape: (K,)\n\n# 3. Find the index of the first valid candidate\n# jnp.argmax finds the first 'True'. Returns 0 if all are False.\nfirst_valid_idx = jnp.argmax(is_valid_mask)\n\n# 4. Check if ANY candidate was valid\nany_valid = is_valid_mask[first_valid_idx]\n\n# 5. Select the first valid proposal (or the original point if none were valid)\npos_prop = jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda x, y: jnp.where(any_valid, x[first_valid_idx], y), pos_candidates, state.position)\nlogp_prop = jnp.where(any_valid, logp_candidates[first_valid_idx], state.logprior)\n\n# 6. NOW proceed to the single likelihood evaluation\nlogl_prop = jnp.where(any_valid, loglikelihood_fn(pos_prop), -jnp.inf)\n```\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   **`while_loop` (Your current approach):**\n    *   **Pros:** Most efficient in terms of total work. If the first proposal is valid, it stops immediately.\n    *   **Cons:** Introduces thread divergence.\n*   **Batch Propose-and-Filter:**\n    *   **Pros:** **Zero thread divergence.** Every walker generates and checks `K` proposals. The execution path is identical for all.\n    *   **Cons:** Potentially wasteful. If the first proposal is always valid, you still pay the cost of generating and checking `K-1` extra ones. Requires more memory for the candidate batch.\n\n**Recommendation:** Stick with your `while_loop` implementation. It is clearer, more direct, and the performance gains will almost certainly be substantial. The batch-and-filter method is a more advanced optimization you could consider *if and only if* profiling reveals that thread divergence in this specific loop is a major bottleneck, which is unlikely given the 100x cost disparity.\n\n### Code Review & Suggestion\n\nYour implementation is solid. However, I see one small area for improvement to make it more robust and potentially more efficient for the compiler.\n\nCurrently, you have:\n```python\n# Run while loop\nis_valid, _, pos_prop, logp_prop, n_proposals = jax.lax.while_loop(...)\n\n# ... redundant prior check ...\nis_in_bounds = jnp.isfinite(logp_final)\n\n# Always evaluate likelihood for final point\nlogl_prop = loglikelihood_fn(pos_prop)\n\n# Accept only if both constraints satisfied\nis_accepted = jnp.logical_and(is_in_bounds, is_above_threshold)\n```\nThe `is_valid` flag returned by the loop already tells you if a valid point was found. It's better to use this flag to conditionally perform the likelihood evaluation. This makes the dependency explicit for the compiler.\n\n**Suggested Refinement:**\n\n```python\n# Run while loop\n# is_valid will be True if the loop exited because a valid point was found.\n# is_valid will be False if the loop exited due to max_proposals.\nis_valid, _, pos_prop, logp_prop, n_proposals = jax.lax.while_loop(cond_fun, body_fun, init)\n\n# Use jnp.where to conditionally evaluate the likelihood.\n# This creates a computation graph where the expensive function call is\n# truly skipped if the condition is False.\nlogl_prop = jnp.where(\n    is_valid,\n    loglikelihood_fn(pos_prop),\n    -jnp.inf  # If no valid point found, assign a failing log-likelihood\n)\n\nis_above_threshold = logl_prop > loglikelihood_0\n\n# The final acceptance now only depends on the likelihood check, as the prior\n# check is encapsulated in the 'is_valid' flag.\nis_accepted = jnp.logical_and(is_valid, is_above_threshold)\n\n# Update state... (your existing logic is fine here)\n# ...\n\n# The likelihood_evals count is now simply the is_valid flag cast to an integer.\nlikelihood_evals = is_valid.astype(jnp.int32)\ninfo = DEInfo(is_accepted=is_accepted, evals=n_proposals, likelihood_evals=likelihood_evals)\n```\nThis is a more idiomatic JAX pattern for conditional execution and makes your intent clearer to both the reader and the compiler.",

      "content": "Of course. This is an excellent and necessary architectural change to align your sampler with a fixed computational budget, which is crucial for predictable performance. Let's create a detailed implementation plan to refactor `de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube`.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Plan: Budget-Based MCMC Walk Kernel**\n\n#### **1. High-Level Goal**\n\nReplace the `fori_loop` in `de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube`, which runs for a fixed number of steps, with a `while_loop` that runs until either a maximum number of steps is reached OR a total budget of likelihood evaluations is exhausted. This provides a hard cap on the computational cost per walker.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Detailed Implementation Steps**\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide answering your questions.\n\n#### **Question 1 & 2: How to Modify `de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube` and What is the New Carry State?**\n\nWe will completely rewrite the core of this function. The new structure will involve defining a larger carry state for the `while_loop` and implementing the `cond_fun` and `body_fun` as you conceptualized.\n\n**Step 1: Update the Function Signature**\nThe function needs to accept the `max_mcmc` budget.\n\n*   **Old Signature:**\n    ```python\n    def de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube(rng_key, state, ..., params, ..., num_survivors, max_proposals):\n    ```\n*   **New Signature:**\n    ```python\n    def de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube(rng_key, state, ..., params, ..., num_survivors, max_proposals, max_mcmc: int):\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Define the New `while_loop` Carry State**\nThe `fori_loop` only needed to carry state that changed *per step*. The `while_loop` needs to carry everything required for the termination condition as well.\n\nThe new `init_val` tuple will be:\n```python\n# (rng_key, current_state, n_accept, total_likelihood_evals, walks_completed)\ninit_val = (\n    rng_key,                              # RNG key for the walk\n    state,                                # The evolving PartitionedState of the particle\n    jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32),        # Accumulator for accepted steps\n    jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32),        # Accumulator for likelihood evaluations (the budget)\n    jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32),        # Accumulator for walks completed\n)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Implement `cond_fun` and `body_fun`**\nThese will be nested inside `de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube`.\n\n*   **`cond_fun`:** This function checks the two termination conditions.\n    ```python\n    def cond_fun(carry):\n        _, _, _, total_likelihood_evals, walks_completed = carry\n        \n        # Condition 1: Have we completed the target number of walks?\n        within_walks_limit = walks_completed < params.num_walks\n        \n        # Condition 2: Are we still under the likelihood evaluation budget?\n        under_budget = total_likelihood_evals < max_mcmc\n        \n        return jnp.logical_and(within_walks_limit, under_budget)\n    ```\n\n*   **`body_fun`:** This function performs one MCMC step and updates the accumulators. This is the same logic as the old `fori_loop` body.\n    ```python\n    def body_fun(carry):\n        key, current_state, n_accept, total_likelihood_evals, walks_completed = carry\n        \n        # Split key for the step\n        step_key, next_key = jax.random.split(key)\n        \n        # Perform one DE MCMC step\n        new_state, info = single_step_fn(step_key, current_state, loglikelihood_0)\n        \n        # Update accumulators\n        updated_n_accept = n_accept + info.is_accepted\n        updated_likelihood_evals = total_likelihood_evals + info.likelihood_evals\n        updated_walks_completed = walks_completed + 1\n        \n        return (next_key, new_state, updated_n_accept, updated_likelihood_evals, updated_walks_completed)\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Replace `fori_loop` with `while_loop`**\nThe main logic of the function now becomes setting up and calling this new loop.\n\n```python\n# (In de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube)\n\n# ... (define single_step_fn as before) ...\n# ... (define cond_fun and body_fun as above) ...\n\n# Initialize the carry state\ninit_val = (rng_key, state, jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32), jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32), jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32))\n\n# Run the while loop\nfinal_key, final_state, final_n_accept, final_n_likelihood_evals, final_walks_completed = jax.lax.while_loop(\n    cond_fun, body_fun, init_val\n)\n\n# ... (Create and return the DEWalkInfo object) ...\n```\n\n#### **Question 3: How do I handle random key management?**\n\nThis is handled correctly by making the `rng_key` part of the loop's carry state.\n\n1.  The `init_val` tuple includes the initial `rng_key` passed to the function.\n2.  Inside `body_fun`, we call `jax.random.split(key)` to generate a key for the current step (`step_key`) and a key for the *next* iteration (`next_key`).\n3.  The `next_key` is returned as the first element of the new carry tuple.\n4.  This ensures that each iteration of the loop uses a unique, fresh random key, preventing reuse and maintaining statistical correctness. The final `rng_key` is also returned, which is good practice.\n\n#### **Question 4: What changes are needed to `DEWalkInfo`?**\n\nThe old `DEWalkInfo` assumed a fixed number of steps. We need to update it to reflect the dynamic number of steps actually taken.\n\n*   **Old `DEWalkInfo`:**\n    ```python\n    class DEWalkInfo(NamedTuple):\n        n_accept: int\n        n_steps: int  # This was a static value from params.num_walks\n        n_likelihood_evals: int\n    ```\n*   **New, More Informative `DEWalkInfo`:**\n    ```python\n    class DEWalkInfo(NamedTuple):\n        \"\"\"Diagnostic information for a full DE MCMC walk.\"\"\"\n        n_accept: int\n        walks_completed: int  # The actual number of steps taken\n        n_likelihood_evals: int  # Total likelihood evaluations (in-bounds only)\n    ```\n    You will create this at the end of `de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube`:\n    ```python\n    # After the while_loop finishes\n    info = DEWalkInfo(\n        n_accept=final_n_accept, \n        walks_completed=final_walks_completed, \n        n_likelihood_evals=final_n_likelihood_evals\n    )\n    return final_state, info\n    ```\n\n#### **Question 5: Are there any JAX compilation concerns with this nested `while_loop` structure?**\n\n**No, there are no fundamental compilation concerns.** JAX is designed to handle nested structured control flow primitives like `while_loop` and `fori_loop`.\n\n*   **How it Works:** JAX's compiler (XLA) does not unroll data-dependent `while_loop`s. It compiles them into efficient, backend-specific loop instructions (e.g., branching in GPU PTX code). This works perfectly fine for nested loops.\n*   **Performance:** The performance implications are algorithmic, not related to compilation correctness. The main performance factor you already addressed is the thread divergence in the *inner* loop. The *outer* loop will also have divergence (some walkers may finish their budget earlier than others in the same `vmap`ped batch), but this is the intended and desired behavior. The computational savings from capping the budget will far outweigh any efficiency loss from this divergence.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Final Refactored Code**\n\nHere is the complete refactored `de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube` function and the necessary changes to its calling context.\n\n**1. Update `DEWalkInfo` NamedTuple:**\n```python\n# In acceptance_walk_kernel.py, update this class definition\n\nclass DEWalkInfo(NamedTuple):\n    \"\"\"Diagnostic information for a full DE MCMC walk.\"\"\"\n    n_accept: int\n    walks_completed: int  # CHANGED: from n_steps, reflects actual steps taken\n    n_likelihood_evals: int\n```\n\n**2. Refactor `de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube`:**\n```python\n# In acceptance_walk_kernel.py, replace the entire function\n\ndef de_rwalk_dynamic_unit_cube(\n    rng_key: jax.Array,\n    state: PartitionedState,\n    logprior_fn: callable,\n    loglikelihood_fn: callable,\n    loglikelihood_0: float,\n    params: DEKernelParams,\n    stepper_fn: callable,\n    num_survivors: int,\n    max_proposals: int = 1000,\n    max_mcmc: int = 5000,  # --- NEW ---: Budget parameter\n):\n    \"\"\"MCMC walk in unit cube, capped by a likelihood evaluation budget.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Partial function for a single step (no change here)\n    one_step_with_static_k = partial(\n        de_rwalk_one_step_unit_cube,\n        num_survivors=num_survivors,\n        max_proposals=max_proposals,\n    )\n    \n    def single_step_fn(rng_key, state, loglikelihood_0):\n        return one_step_with_static_k(\n            rng_key=rng_key,\n            state=state, \n            logprior_fn=logprior_fn,\n            loglikelihood_fn=loglikelihood_fn,\n            loglikelihood_0=loglikelihood_0,\n            params=params,\n            stepper_fn=stepper_fn,\n        )\n\n    # --- NEW: while_loop implementation ---\n\n    def cond_fun(carry):\n        \"\"\"Continue looping if within walk limits AND under budget.\"\"\"\n        _, _, _, total_likelihood_evals, walks_completed = carry\n        within_walks_limit = walks_completed < params.num_walks\n        under_budget = total_likelihood_evals < max_mcmc\n        return jnp.logical_and(within_walks_limit, under_budget)\n\n    def body_fun(carry):\n        \"\"\"Perform one MCMC step and update accumulators.\"\"\"\n        key, current_state, n_accept, total_likelihood_evals, walks_completed = carry\n        \n        step_key, next_key = jax.random.split(key)\n        new_state, info = single_step_fn(step_key, current_state, loglikelihood_0)\n        \n        # Update the carry state for the next iteration\n        return (\n            next_key, \n            new_state, \n            n_accept + info.is_accepted, \n            total_likelihood_evals + info.likelihood_evals,\n            walks_completed + 1\n        )\n\n    # --- Initialize and run the loop ---\n    init_val = (\n        rng_key, \n        state, \n        jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32), \n        jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32), \n        jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32)\n    )\n    \n    _final_key, final_state, final_n_accept, final_n_likelihood_evals, final_walks_completed = jax.lax.while_loop(\n        cond_fun, body_fun, init_val\n    )\n\n    # --- Create the updated info object ---\n    info = DEWalkInfo(\n        n_accept=final_n_accept, \n        walks_completed=final_walks_completed, \n        n_likelihood_evals=final_n_likelihood_evals\n    )\n    \n    return final_state, info\n```\n\n**3. Update `bilby_adaptive_de_sampler_unit_cube` to Pass `max_mcmc`:**\n```python\n# In acceptance_walk_kernel.py, find this function and update the `partial` call\n\ndef bilby_adaptive_de_sampler_unit_cube(\n    # ... other args ...\n    max_mcmc: int = 5000,\n    # ... other args ...\n) -> SamplingAlgorithm:\n    # ...\n    \n    # ...

(rest of the function is the same) ...\n```\nThis final change ensures that the `max_mcmc` budget you define at the sampler level is correctly passed down to the MCMC walk kernel.",
